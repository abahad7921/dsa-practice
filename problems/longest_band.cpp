/*
    Problem: Given n elements, find the lenght of the largest band is a subsequence
    
    Band: A band is defined as a subsequence which can be reordered in such a manner
    all elements appear consecutive(ie with absolute difference of 1 between neigbouring elements)
    
    A longest is a subsequence which contains the maximum integers
    
    Input: arr = [1,9,3,0,18,5,2,4,10,7,12,6]
    
    Output: 8
